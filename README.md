# Open Frameworks Plugin FFGL Effect Test for OSX and Xcode


##Dependencies

- [Open Frameworks (~v0.8.4)](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks) - I've only test this with the stable build of v0.8.4.
- [ofxFFGLplugin](https://code.google.com/p/ofxffglplugin/) - There are some issues with the latest version that need to be patched. I'd advise using the updated version at [robksawyer/ofFFGLPlugin](https://github.com/robksawyer/ofFFGLPlugin).


##Tips

For FFGL development, it's important to have some understanding of GLSL shader language. A good book to get started with is [OpenGL Shading Language, Second Edition](http://wiki.labomedia.org/images/1/10/Orange_Book_-_OpenGL_Shading_Language_2nd_Edition.pdf), but there are several other sources on the Internet. The [OpenGL SuperBible](http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/ligangliu/forstudents/C++/OpenGL%20Super%20Bible.pdf) is helpful for understanding the whole OpenGL context.

- Forum post [ofxFFGL with Xcode5 and OF080](http://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/ofxffgl-with-xcode5-and-of080/14031/28) on <forum.openframeworks.cc>. - This is basically where most of the project came from. Thanks should go to davidemania.
- [FFGL SDK](http://freeframe.sourceforge.net/) - The SDK includes 4 demo plugins, but don't expect to be able to compile them. I didn't have any luck.
- The [Resolume forum](http://resolume.com/forum/) has a pretty good list of 3rd-party FFGL plugins and some links to GLSL shaders.
- [Matias Wilkman](http://matiaswilkman.blogspot.co.at/search/label/ffgl) has some nice examples at [assembla.com](https://www.assembla.com/code/ffgl/subversion/nodes/14/trunk/Source/FFGLPlugins).
